A simple and elegant To-Do List web application built using HTML and CSS with no external libraries or frameworks. This project aims to provide a user-friendly task management experience with a focus on accessibility and subtle animations.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Use the text box at the top to add new tasks to the list. Click the "+" icon to insert the task.

- **Delete Tasks**: Each task comes with a "Delete" button. Clicking it removes the task completely from the list.

- **Check Off Tasks**: Keep track of completed tasks with checkboxes. Checked items remain in the list with differentiation from the rest of the tasks.

- **Task Count**: The total number of tasks in the list is displayed, helping you stay organized.

- **Accessibility**: We've taken care to make this application accessible to all users. Proper HTML semantics and ARIA attributes have been included for screen reader support.

- **Subtle Animations**: Enjoy smooth and subtle animations that enhance the user experience without being distracting.

## Usage

1. **Add a Task**: Type your task in the text box at the top and click the "+" icon.

2. **Delete a Task**: Click the "Delete" button next to the task to remove it from the list.

3. **Check Off a Task**: Mark a task as completed by checking the checkbox next to it.
